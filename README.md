# NimbleLZ4 🗜️

> [LZ4] compression library for Elixir that uses Rust NIFs.

## Installation

Add this to your dependencies in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # ...,
    {:nimble_lz4, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

NimbleLZ4 requires OTP 23+ and Elixir 1.11+.

### Native Code

NimbleLZ4 uses [RustlerPrecompiled] to build precompiled version of the
necessary Rust NIFs bindings for a variety of platforms, NIF versions, and
operating systems. RustlerPrecompiled should automatically download the correct
version of the bindings when compiling NimbleLZ4 as a dependency of your
application.

You can **force compilation** of the native code by setting the
`NIMBLELZ4_FORCE_BUILD` environment variable to `true`:

```shell
NIMBLELZ4_FORCE_BUILD=true mix deps.compile
```

## Usage

You can compress and decompress data.

```elixir
iex> uncompressed = :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(10)
iex> compressed = NimbleLZ4.compress(uncompressed)
iex> {:ok, ^uncompressed} = NimbleLZ4.decompress(compressed, _uncompressed_size = 10)
true
```
